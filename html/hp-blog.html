        <p>When Hewlett-Packard acquired Apollo Computer in 1989, the latter had already developed a backup system entitled the "OmniBack Network Backup System," which was available on the market at the time.[2] HP continued[3] to develop this product under the "OmniBack" name for the purpose of backing up individual files and raw disk partitions. A related but distinct product "OmniBack/Turbo" was developed for backing up databases.[4]

        In 1996 HP released OmniBack II 2.0 and merged OmniBack II and OmniBack/Turbo into a single product, although it was still impossible to create a single job which would contain a database and a file system backup. It was offered for $3,800.[5] A Windows NT port was released with version 2.3.[6] Version 2.55 was released in 1997 and included support for HP-UX and IBM AIX.[7]</p>

        <p>He company got its first big contract in 1938, providing its test and measurement instruments for production of Walt Disney's hugely successful animated film Fantasia. This success led Hewlett and Packard to formally establish their Hewlett-Packard Company on January 1, 1939. The company grew into a multinational corporation widely respected for its products, and its management style and culture known as the HP Way, which was adopted by other businesses worldwide. HP was the world's leading PC manufacturer from 2007 until the second quarter of 2013, when Lenovo moved ahead of HP.[1][2][3] HP specialized in developing and manufacturing computing, data storage, and networking hardware, designing software and delivering services. Major product lines included personal computing devices, enterprise and industry standard servers, related storage devices, networking products, software and a diverse range of printers and other imaging products. HP directly marketed its products to households, small- to medium-sized businesses and enterprises as well as via online distribution, consumer-electronics and office-supply retailers, software partners and major technology vendors. HP also offered services and a consulting business for its products and partner products.</p>
